# Mini-project for L45 Representation Learning on Graphs and Networks

This repository contains the central pieces of codes for my mini-project for L45 Representation Learning on Graphs and Networks.

In this project, we investigate DE-MF, a method for learning on structured data proposed by [Dai et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05629).
The method provides a connection between graphical models and graph neural networks, and, interestingly, shows some similarity to the popular message
passing neural network (MPNN). 
We first give a revision of the method, along with a simple and effective extension.
Then we closely compare it to the MPNN with experiments. 
By identifying their key differences, we notice a new possibility of improving networkâ€™s performance with limited number of parameters.
